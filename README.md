# Motivation

The package `frint` is built for serving our specific needs at [Travix International](http://travix.com).

We have various teams in the front-end department simultaneously building new and also existing applications. Our goal is to abstract away any third-party framework specific code, so that we can safely and smoothly change the inner parts in future without affecting any of the teams workflow.

## Key goals

* One single API to build front-end applications
* The API becomes the stable abstraction layer
* Allows us to change/optimize the underlying code with ease
* Our application code hardly needs to change any more
* Gives us a structure to build and scale our applications

## Installation

With **npm**:

```
$ npm install --save frint
```
